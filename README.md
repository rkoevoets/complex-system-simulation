# Usage
For the main file to run simple simulations:\
`python main_numpy.py [network_type] [network_size (int)] [iterations (int)]`

To change other parameters, you can change it within the code file.
By default (no arguments), the program will run the model with a random network of size 100.

Network types:
- random
- small-world
- scale-free
- grid
